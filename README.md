# KNN_-Classification-Algorithm-Using-Fruits_Data
## Project Description: 
KNN Is a K Nearest Neighbour Classification, 

## Problem Statement:

- Define the problem: "Classify different types of fruits based on their characteristics."
- Identify the dataset: "Fruits dataset" containing features like color, shape, size, and texture.
  
##  Data Preprocessing

- Import necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
- Load the fruits dataset.
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Encode categorical variables (if any).
- Scale/normalize the data using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

## Data Exploration

- Visualize the data using histograms, box plots, or scatter plots.
- Analyze the distribution of each feature.
- Identify correlations between feature
  
##  Splitting Data
- Split the preprocessed data into training (70-80%) and testing sets (20-30%).

## KNN Model Implementation

- Import the KNN classifier from scikit-learn.
- Initialize the KNN model with a chosen value of k (number of nearest neighbors).
- Train the model using the training data.

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the trained model using the testing data.
- Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Use cross-validation to ensure robust results.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the value of k.
- Use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

## Model Deployment

- Once the model is trained and evaluated, deploy it in a production-ready environment.
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
 
## Model Maintenance
- Continuously monitor the model's performance on new data.
- Update the model as necessary to maintain its accuracy and relevance.

## Example Code (Python):

## Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

## Load the fruits dataset
fruits_data = pd.read_csv('fruits.csv')

## Preprocess the data
X = fruits_data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = fruits_data['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Train the KNN model
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test_scaled)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print('Classification Report:')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
